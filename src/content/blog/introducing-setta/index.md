## No More Donkeywork!

We’re excited to launch **Setta**, a **general purpose, open-source config & user interface tool for Python**. With Setta, configuration & user interfaces are _one and the same._

**Simplify your life with Setta:** It eliminates the need for YAML files, config parsers, _and_ frontend code. Plus, you don't have to think about styling the UI, _and_ it makes onboarding other devs and users easier. Intrigued?

## Try it out!

See our [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/settadev/setta?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started), or check out our [example projects](https://github.com/settadev/examples):

### [Stream Diffusion Image-to-Image](https://github.com/settadev/examples/tree/main/stream_diffusion_img_to_img)

## What Setta Is _Not_

- **Not a WYSIWYG Web Builder**: Setta won’t generate custom HTML pages. It produces standardized, interactive components inside its own interface.
- **Not a Visual Programming System**: You still write regular Python. Setta just provides a streamlined UI so you and other users can interact with your functions without wrestling with frontend code or config files.

## What’s Next?

We're actively developing Setta. In our latest releases, we've added:

- Support for chat interfaces through a new "Chat" section type
- Artifact management improvements

And there's a whole lot more on the way!
