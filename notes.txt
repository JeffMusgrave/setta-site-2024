Subtitle ideas:
- Setta is a configuration development environment and user interface canvas that skips the boilerplate code.
- Say goodbye to all that config parsing and boilerplate code.
- Like if Figma, YAML, and Python had a child. 


Flexible UI:
- Create, organize, and set your configs in a flexible drag-and-drop user interface.

Built for Devs:
- Write your core logic wherever you want, whether that's inside a Setta code block, or in your favorite IDE. 
- Set your configs inside Setta, with autocompletions, type-checking, and refactoring support. 
- Run. No config parsers needed. 
- Auto-export your Setta projects in a Git-friendly yaml format.


Powerful Config Management:
- Version your configs at a granular level. 
- Share configurations between projects. 
- Run param sweeps across both scalar values and config versions.

Customizable, Integrated Documentation:
- Integrate documentation, tooltips, markdown, social content, images, and interactive elements to make configurations more approachable.


Works for scripts that take a while...:
- Configure your machine-learning training runs, LLM evals, and data analysis scripts.

...and for Real-Time Interactive Apps
- Configure interactive applications that run directly in Setta, like AI image generation demos, and data visualizations.
